--WHAT--------
Custom iOS geocoding and reverse geocoding services that call Google's JSON geocoding services directly.


--WHY---------
- To avoid a long-standing, random failure condition in MKReverseGeocoder, possibly due to usage of old APIs, or hitting a usage limit imposed by Google. A google search will bring up many documented cases of the issue, such as...

"MKErrorDomain error 4 iPhone" - Stack Overflow

"MKReverseGeoCoder error 4" - iPhone Dev SDK Forum
http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/63047-mkreversegeocoder-error-4-a.html


- To provide forward geocoding (find coordinate from location), which is not provided in iOS' standard Location Services.

--OTHER NOTES-
- Any comments regarding the services, suggestions, notes on bugs or comments on the MKReverseGeocoder failure issue are welcome. 

- The services rely on the open source Objective-C JSON framework (http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/) it's only been tested with the version included with the project.
